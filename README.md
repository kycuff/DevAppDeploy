# DevAppDeploy

DevAppDeploy is a prototype internal distribution platform developed to address the gap left by Microsoft’s Visual Studio App Center retirement. It offers a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution to manage beta versions of Android mobile applications, with future support for additional platforms.

## 📦 Overview

Microsoft App Center was widely used in mobile development for distributing beta applications, crash reporting, and app store releases. Its deprecation has disrupted workflows for teams relying on its distribution features.

DevAppDeploy fills this void by enabling:

- Controlled release of mobile application versions
- Efficient quality assurance testing
- Version rollback and parallel testing—functionality lacking in most alternatives

## 🔍 Project Objectives

This final-year work-based project showcases the full software development lifecycle, employing industry best practices:

- Literature Review
- Requirements Analysis
- System Design
- Implementation
- Evaluation

## 🔐 Key Features

- **Secure Authentication** – .Net Identity integration for protected access  
- **Role-Based Access Control** – Ensures appropriate access for testers and developers  
- **Package File Storage** – Secure cloud-based storage for APKs  
- **Application Version Management** – Supports tracking, rollback, and concurrent version testing

## ☁️ Technologies Used

- Azure Cloud Services  
- ASP.NET Core with Blazor  
- SQL-based database management  
- RESTful APIs  
- Integration with modern repositories (Azure DevOps)

## 📈 Outcome

DevAppDeploy offers a viable and flexible internal distribution tool tailored to the needs of digital service teams.
